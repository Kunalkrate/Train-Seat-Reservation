For the train seat reservation system, hereâ€™s a suggested database structure using MongoDB:

1. Seats Collection
This collection will store the information for each seat in the coach.

json

{
   "_id": "ObjectId",
   "seatNumber": "String",     // e.g., "1A", "2B", etc.
   "isBooked": "Boolean",      // true if the seat is booked, false otherwise
   "bookedBy": "String",       // Optional: Name or ID of the user who booked the seat (if required)
   "bookingTimestamp": "Date", // Optional: Timestamp when the seat was booked
}
Example document:

json

{
   "_id": "6132a4f8a2b9b67fbb08",
   "seatNumber": "1A",
   "isBooked": true,
   "bookedBy": "user123",
   "bookingTimestamp": "2024-09-29T10:00:00Z"
}
2. Booking Collection (Optional)
If you want to track individual bookings (e.g., group bookings), you can create a bookings collection.

json

{
   "_id": "ObjectId",
   "bookingId": "String",    // Unique ID for each booking
   "seats": ["String"],      // List of seat numbers booked (e.g., ["1A", "1B"])
   "bookedBy": "String",     // User who made the booking (optional)
   "bookingTimestamp": "Date" // Date and time of the booking
}
Example document:


Copy code
{
   "_id": "6132a4f8a2b9b6b78542",
   "bookingId": "booking001",
   "seats": ["1A", "1B"],
   "bookedBy": "user123",
   "bookingTimestamp": "2024-09-29T10:05:00Z"
}
Key Points:
Seats collection handles the seat availability.
Booking collection (optional) handles group bookings and historical booking data.
